This MATLAB script was developed to semi-automatically measure body size of <i>C. elegans</i> from PNG images taken on an Evos Cell Imaging System microscope at 4X. It accepts a directory containing PNG files and produces a directory with text files incluing area measurements and a directory with labeled images for visual inspection. This script has been used in the following publication: 

<b> Giese GE, Walker MD, Ponomarova O, Zhang H, Li X, Minevich G, Walhout AJ. C. elegans methionine/S-adenosylmethionine cycle activity is sensed and adjusted by a nuclear hormone receptor. Elife. 2020 Oct 5;9:e60259. doi: 10.7554/eLife.60259. PMID: 33016879.</b>
